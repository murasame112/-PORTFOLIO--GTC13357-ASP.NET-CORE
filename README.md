# GTC13357

Project of webpage to manage shop with courses (ASP.NET CORE)

1 - In code, Course stands for Participants, and a CourseTitle stands for Coruses. It's because it was a project for my studies, and idea for it kind of evolved during the time as we learned more and more new things, and I'll be honest - I didn't have time to repair it before deadline and I was afraid to "just change names" with Ctrl+RR. Anyway - in fronend everything looks alright, but in code it's a bit messed up with names.

2 - Add some records to CourseTypes first, since it's child-table of CourseTitle

3 - Attach action exists to attach records in Course and CourseTitle (they are in many-to-many relationship)
